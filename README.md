# Option-Pricing-Algorithms

## SUTD 40.242 Derivative Pricing & Risk Management

### Python Implementation of 4 option pricing methods:

- Monte Carlo simulation
- Binomial Option pricing model 
- Black-Scholes
- Put-call parity

### Model Parameters

We will price options on a stock with 15% annualized volatility of log returns. We will assume that when the option is valued:

1. The stock price is $50
2. The stock pays an annualized 2% dividend. The dividend is paid continuously throughout the year.
3. The annualized risk-free rate is 5% (at a continuously compounded rate).

We will value European put and call options. Both have a strike price of $55 & will expire one year and two months from now. 

Assume a 360 day year, with 30 days in each month.
